# Reliance-Stock-Price-Prediction-
In this project, we aimed to forecast the stock prices of Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm, a powerful time series machine learning model. Time series data represents a sequence of observations collected over time, and predicting stock prices is a classic example of a time series forecasting problem.

The first step in our project was data collection and preprocessing. We gathered historical stock price data of Reliance from reliable financial sources. Preprocessing involved handling missing values, adjusting for splits and dividends, and converting the data into a suitable format for training the LSTM model. We also performed feature engineering to extract relevant information and create input sequences for the model.

In conclusion, our project successfully implemented the LSTM algorithm for Reliance stock price prediction, showcasing the potential of deep learning techniques in forecasting financial time series data. It also highlights the importance of proper data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation in developing accurate and reliable machine learning models.
